//! The `Data` classes, resolved once at load and pinned, and the rule every
//! value read from Ruby passes. The exact-class check and clone-then-keep
//! are `matryona_machines::ruby`'s.
//!
//! A value read back is either an instance of exactly this gem's class, whose
//! fields are read straight from the struct (no reader runs), or a sibling
//! gem's value of the same shape, read by its public readers. A subclass of
//! this gem's class is neither: the constant leaks past the seal and
//! `Data#initialize` can be bound directly, so it is a `TypeError`. Whatever
//! was read is then rebuilt through the core constructor, which `Marshal.load`
//! skipped.
